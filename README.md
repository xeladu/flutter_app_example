The repository contains the code of a Flutter app documented in the linked blog posts **and as an ebook 📗**. For detailed information see the specific posts. There is a tag associated with each post with the matching code base.

## Ebook

Find the ebook on my [Gumroad page](https://xeladu.gumroad.com/). It's totally free, offers a better reading experience than the blog posts, and more detailled information. If you like it, please rate it.
